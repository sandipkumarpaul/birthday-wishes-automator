## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Create a Google Sheet:** Set up a new sheet with three columns with the exact headers: `FullName`, `Email`, and `DOB` (in MM/DD/YYYY format).

2.  **Add the Script:**
    *   Open the sheet and go to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.
    *   Copy the code from the `BirthdayWisher.gs` file in this repository and paste it into the script editor.

3.  **Customize the Email:**
    *   Inside the code, find the `subject` and `messageBody` variables and edit them with your own personalized message.

4.  **Set Up the Trigger:**
    *   In the Apps Script editor, go to the "Triggers" (alarm clock) section.
    *   Create a new trigger for the `sendBirthdayWishes` function.
    *   Configure the trigger to be `Time-driven` and run on a `Day timer` (e.g., every morning between 8am and 9am).

5.  **Authorize Permissions:**
    *   Run the script once manually or save the trigger to initiate the authorization prompt from Google. You must allow the script to access your sheets and send email on your behalf.
